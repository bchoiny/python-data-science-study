# python-data-science-study

This repo is for data science projects and guided exercises in Python 3 from online courses and books.  
Projects I independently work on will have their own repo and/or be on Kaggle.

I'm utilizing multiple resources listed below in order to have a good understanding of both application and theory of machine learning.

1. Udemy - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Progress: 40%)  
  This online course covers broad range of applications of machine learning  
    a. Data Capstone Project - (to be updated)
  
2. Stanford Online - Statistical Learning (Progress: 40%)  
  This course covers logic and theory behind ML which I think are very important to understand to become a good data scientist  
  The course was originally taught in R, but I'm learning with Python variant of it (https://github.com/Pierian-Data/ISLR-python)
  
3. Book - An Introduction to Statistical Learning (Progress: 30%)  
  This is a companion book of Stanford Online course above. I read it on my iPad during my commute
  
4. Coursera - Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Progress: 5%)  
  Covers similar topics as above, but uses linear algebra which the courses above try to avoid. The course was originally taught in Octave, but I plan to learn it with Python variant (https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)
  
5. Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai (Progress: 0%)  
  I'm not sure how long it will take for me to get here, but I will be very excited to learn more advanced techniques like NN
  
I'm currently using 1-4 concurrently as each have pros and cons and they complement each other well. From time to time, I plan to work on my personal projects, participate in Kaggle competitions and internal DS competitions at work.
